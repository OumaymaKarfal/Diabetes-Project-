# Diabetes-Project-
Diabetes analysis project 

In this project, I used two machine learning models to predict the onset of diabetes in patients, the Logistic Regression model and the Random Forest model.

This project uses a dataset that contains several features connected to diabetes, such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and glucose level. I used different models which are the Random forest model and the Logistic regression model to build predictive models and compared their performance.

After thorough evaluation and testing, I have determined that the Random Forest model outperforms the Logistic Regression model in terms of accuracy and predictive power. Hence, I have chosen the Random Forest model as the final model for diabetes prediction.

Both the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest models are implemented in the Python code, along with thorough justifications and visual representations of the outcomes. I think that my idea will be beneficial to researchers and medical professionals involved in the field of diabetes prediction.

I appreciate you looking at my GitHub project!
